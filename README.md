# Product-Management-App

Creating a Windows Forms application ProductMaintenance that lets the user maintain products. The application consists of two forms as described below.
You may setup Entity Framework Core Database First in the same project (create Models folder to place generated classes in it), or if you prefer you may make a separate library class project TechSupportData.

Main Form displays data of all products and allows the user to select one modify or delete.

When user clicks on Add or Modify, second form is displayed as modal form.
When the form is used for Add it should display empty text boxes and the title should read Add Product. When it is used for modify, data of product to update should be displayed and title should read Modify Product.
